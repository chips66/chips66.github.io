Hello, my name is Chris Hinds. I'm a biology major at UT Austin, and I'm pre-med. In addition to biology, I enjoy coding from time to time. Here is a little bit of python and R that I have learned!

Also, here's another picture of me from when I went hiking in Colorado.

```{R}
#R
library(reticulate)
library(ggplot2)

reticulateisfun <- "Biology major at the University of Texas at Austin"
```

```{python}
#Python
one = 1
two = 2
five = 5
ten = 10
one + five * ten

list=[1,20,290,-1,63,14,613]
max(list)
min(list)
list[3:6]

myname = 'Christopher Mark Hinds'
myeid = 'cmh5256'
myname + ', ' + myeid

print(myname, "\n", r.reticulateisfun)

x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]
y = [15,14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
```

```{R}
#R
9*py$five

ggplot()+geom_point(aes(py$x,py$y))
```
