      <description>Hello, my name is Chris Hinds. I’m a biology major at UT Austin, and I’m pre-med. In addition to biology, I enjoy coding from time to time. Here is a little bit of python and R that I have learned!
Also, here’s another picture of me from when I went hiking in Colorado. #R library(reticulate) library(ggplot2) reticulateisfun &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;Biology major at the University of Texas at Austin&amp;quot; #Python one = 1 two = 2 five = 5 ten = 10 one + five * ten ## 51 list=[1,20,290,-1,63,14,613] max(list) ## 613 min(list) ## -1 list[3:6] ## [-1, 63, 14] myname = &amp;#39;Christopher Mark Hinds&amp;#39; myeid = &amp;#39;cmh5256&amp;#39; myname + &amp;#39;, &amp;#39; + myeid ## &amp;#39;Christopher Mark Hinds, cmh5256&amp;#39; print(myname, &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;, r.</description>

      <description>Texas College Data I have chosen two datasets that consist of academic information regarding most of the universities in Texas for 2021. I obtained the “Texas_College_Acceptance_Rates_2021” dataset from acceptancerates.com, and I obtained the “Texas_College_Rank_SAT_2021” from USNews.com.
The “Texas_College_Acceptance_Rates_2021” dataset includes the variables ‘School’, ‘Applicants’, ‘Admitted’, and ‘Acceptance.Rate’.
The The “Texas_College_Rank_SAT_2021” dataset includes the variables ‘School’, Popularity.Rank’, and SAT.75.Perc’. ‘Popularity.Rank’ is simply a ranking based on certain criteria such as accreditation and degrees offered.</description>

      <description>For project 2, I have selected a dataset from the R library that includes responses from a survey on extramarital affairs conducted by Psychology Today in 1969. The dataset has variables like ‘affairs’ which tells how many affairs each person has had in the last year. ‘gender’, ‘age’, and ‘yearsmarried’ are all self-explanatory. ‘education’ tells the number of years of education completed by the participant. Last, ‘rating’ is a self-rating of the participant’s current marriage with ‘1’ meaning “very unhappy” and ‘5’ meaning “very happy.</description>
