      <description>Texas College Data I have chosen two datasets that consist of academic information regarding most of the universities in Texas for 2021. I obtained the “Texas_College_Acceptance_Rates_2021” dataset from acceptancerates.com, and I obtained the “Texas_College_Rank_SAT_2021” from USNews.com.
The “Texas_College_Acceptance_Rates_2021” dataset includes the variables ‘School’, ‘Applicants’, ‘Admitted’, and ‘Acceptance.Rate’.
The The “Texas_College_Rank_SAT_2021” dataset includes the variables ‘School’, Popularity.Rank’, and SAT.75.Perc’. ‘Popularity.Rank’ is simply a ranking based on certain criteria such as accreditation and degrees offered.</description>

Last, ‘rating’ is a self-rating of the participant’s current marriage with ‘1’ meaning “very unhappy” and ‘5’ meaning “very happy.</description>
